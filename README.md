# Graphing Calculator

## Overview

This project is a web-based graphing calculator that offers both standard scientific calculator functionalities and graph plotting capabilities. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The calculator allows users to perform various mathematical operations and graph functions directly in their web browser.

## Features

- **Scientific Calculator**: Supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, and more.
- **Graphing Functionality**: Allows users to input a mathematical function and plot its graph.
- **Memory Management**: Users can save and display results, sum values stored in memory, and clear memory when needed.
- **Rad/Deg Toggle**: Users can switch between radians and degrees for trigonometric calculations.
- **Interactive Interface**: Responsive design with interactive buttons and real-time graph plotting.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the calculator's interface.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the calculator, providing a clean and modern look.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code that handles all the functionality, including calculations and graph plotting.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser to launch the calculator.
3. Use the calculator for arithmetic operations, trigonometric calculations, or graph plotting.

## How to Use

### Calculator

1. Enter numbers and operators using the provided buttons.
2. Click `=` to evaluate the expression.
3. Use the `C` button to clear the display.
4. Click `Rad` or `Deg` to switch between radians and degrees.
5. Use the memory functions to store, display, or sum values.

### Graphing
